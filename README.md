# Book Recommendation System
## Description:
Our project is a Book Recommendation System that helps users find books they'll love based on what they like to read. Weâ€™ll use a smart scoring system that considers each user's favorite genres, similar readers, and book ratings to suggest the best matches. The recommendations will include clear explanations about why each book was chosen, making it easier for users to trust and understand the suggestions. By using a bit of AI, we'll make these explanations feel more natural and personal, almost like a friend recommending a book. This will create a fun, engaging, and truly helpful way to discover new reads.
